## Speaking

If you would like to speak at our meetup please submit a github issue using our [Talk Submission Template](https://github.com/newyorkkotlinmeetup/nyc-kotlin-meetup/issues/new).

Please don't submit talk _requests_, only something that _you_ would like to present.

If you would like to submit your idea anonymously feel free to use our old [Talk Submission Form](https://bit.ly/kotlin-nyc-speaking) instead.

### Post-Speaking

After speaking at one of our events feel free to upload any code as a Pull-Request. Please include the talk date and title in the PR title. These PRs can take any format and will not be merged.

You can also post a link to your slides, personal GitHub repo, etc to the meetup.com page for the event you spoke at.

If you've taken pictures of videos of the event feel free to do the same.
